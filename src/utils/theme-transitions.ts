 * The previous JavaScript-based transition handling was overly complex and caused performance issues.
 * A simpler, more performant CSS-only approach is now used. Theme transitions are handled
 * by applying a CSS transition to the `body` and using Tailwind's `transition-colors` utility
 * on specific components. This eliminates the need for any JavaScript-based transition management.
